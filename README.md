# Customer Lifetime Value Prediction

This project focuses on predicting **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** using historical purchase and demographic data. The predicted LTV is used to assist in **targeted marketing** and **customer segmentation**.

## Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Missing value handling  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Feature engineering: Frequency, Recency, AOV (Average Order Value)

2. **Model Training**  
   - Train `XGBRegressor` on customer data  
   - Evaluate using `MAE`, `RMSE`, and `RÂ² Score`

3. **Prediction**  
   - Predict LTV for each customer  
   - Export predictions to `ltv_predictions.csv`

4. **Customer Segmentation**  
   - Segment customers into groups based on LTV range (Low, Medium, High)  
   - Visualized in `visuals.pdf`
